# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This repository provides reusable scripts and notebooks to transform raw tweets into labeled data, train several baseline and advanced sentiment models, and produce reproducible evaluation and visualizations.

## Summary

This project aims to detect whether a tweet expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It supports data collection from Twitter, text cleaning and augmentation, feature extraction (traditional and neural), and model trainingز
Use cases:
- Monitor public opinion about a brand or topic
- Build dashboards for social listening
- Experiment with NLP models on short-text social data

## Highlights / Key Features

- Text preprocessing: normalization, tokenization, stopword removal, emoji handling
- Feature extraction: word embeddings
- Model options: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, LSTM, Transformer fine-tuning
- Training utilities: configurable experiments, checkpointing, reproducible seeds
- Evaluation: precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, and visualization notebooks
- Exportable models and prediction scripts for production use

## Technologies

- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow 
- nltk / spaCy for preprocessing
- matplotlib / seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for exploration

## Quickstart — Local

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdelhamidNasser946/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage — Typical Pipeline

1. Preprocess raw text

2. Extract features (example: TF-IDF)

3. Train a model

4. Evaluate

5. Make predictions

Notes:
- There are example notebooks in `notebooks/` demonstrating full experiments and visualizations.
- Use `--help` for each script to see available options and config flags.

## Modeling Approach

- Baseline: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (fast, interpretable)
- Classical ML: SVM, Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning via grid or random search
- Neural: LSTM/GRU for sequence modeling using pre-trained embeddings (GloVe/fastText)
- Transformer-based: Fine-tune a BERT-family model for best performance on labelled tweets

Evaluation metrics include overall accuracy, macro/micro F1, per-class precision/recall, and confusion matrix visualizations. Use cross-validation and stratified splits for reliable estimates.

## Data & Labeling

- Expected input columns (CSV/JSONL): id, text, created_at, user_id, lang, (optional) label
- Label format: {positive, negative, neutral, irrelevant} or {0, 1, 2, 3} 



## Tips for Improving Performance

- Clean and normalize tweet text carefully: remove noise, handle emojis and URLs, expand contractions.
- Use balanced training or class-weighted losses for skewed label distributions.
- Try transfer learning with a Twitter-pretrained transformer (e.g., BERTweet) for large gains.
- Augment data with paraphrases or back-translation for low-resource settings.
